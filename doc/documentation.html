<h1>kXML 2 Documentation</h1>


<p>kXML 2 implements the XmlPull API. Please find general information about
XmlPull parsers including the interface documentation at 
<a href="http://xmlpull.org">xmlpull.org</a>.</p>

<p>Naveen Balani has written a <a 
href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/wi-dw-wi-kxml-i.html">nice 
introduction to kxml 2</a> for IBM Developer Works.</p>

<p>For kXML specific classes, in particular for WBXML, please refer
to the kXML API Documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kobjects.net/projects/kxml/www/api/">kXML JavaDoc</a>
</ul>


<h2>Special Features</h2>

<p>kXML has two "special" features that are intended to simplify developers' life in constrained environments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for <em>WBXML</em> (WAP binary encoded XML): Allows to parse WAP or Wireless Village content</li>
<li>A robust <em>"relaxed" mode</em> for parsing HTML or SGML files (that are not well-formed XML documents) in order to avoid 
 the need of two separate parsers in mobile phones.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Recommended Calling Conventions</h2>

When handing an XMLpull parser to subroutines, it is recommended that the current 
position is on a start tag (allowing the subroutine to analyze the attributes). 
The post condition should usually be that the current position is the matching end tag.


<h2>Parsing Element-Only and Text-Only Content</h2>

<p>General XML content can be parsed with the XML pull API using a loop advanving
to the next event and a switch statement that depends on the event type. However, 
when using XML for data transfer (in contrast to text documents), most XML elements 
contain either only text or only other elements (possibly with further sub-elements). 
For those common cases, the parsing process can be simplified significantly by
using the XmlPull API methods <em>nextTag</em> and <em>nextText</em>. 

Additionally, the method <em>require()</em> may optionally be used to assert a 
certain parser state.  The following sample illustrates both situations and methods. 
The outer element <em>elements</em> has element-only content; the contained 
<em>text</em>-elements have text-only content:</p>

<pre>
&lt;elements&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;text1&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;text2&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/elements&gt;  
</pre>  

<p>Parsing Code</p>
<pre>
parser.nextTag();
parser.require(XmlPullParser.START_TAG, null, "elements");

while(parser.nextTag() == XmlPullParser.START_TAG) {
  parser.require(XmlPullParser.START_TAG, null, "text");

   // handle element content
   System.out.println("text content: "+ parser.nextText());

  parser.require(XmlPullParser.END_TAG, null, "text");
}

parser.require(XmlPullParser.END_TAG, null, "elements");
</pre>

<p><em>nextTag()</em> advances to the next 
start or end tag, skipping insignificant events such as white space, 
comments and PIs. <em>nextText()</em> requires that the current position 
is a start tag. It returns the text content of the corresponding element. 
The post condition is that the current position is an end tag.
Please note that the calls <em>require()</em> are optional assertions, 
they may be left out completely. </p>
